Bug Fixes


    * Addressed an issue causing people to receive an "Internal Battle.net Error" message with their game client.
    * Muting your microphone will no longer cause your microphone to be turned off in the operating system once the program has exited.

          o Please note that the voice chat functionality has only partially been implemented. There are many known issues with voice chat that we expect to address in a future patch.

    * The "Medium" graphical settings were reconfigured to work better on appropriate machines. The video settings "auto-detect" functionality has been reset as a result.
    * Added a frame rate limiter to the game menus to prevent some graphics cards from running at higher frame rates than necessary.
    * Added GRB rating tags to the login menu for the Korean version of the Beta client.
