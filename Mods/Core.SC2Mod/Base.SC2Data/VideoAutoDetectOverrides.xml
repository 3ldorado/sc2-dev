<!-- HOW TO USE THIS FILE -->
    
<!-- By default, every video card will be autodetected by the game and assigned to a particular quality
     setting based on the card family.  For example, a GeForce 7600 GS is a part of the GeForce 7000 family and
     is thus automatically assigned to a High Overall Quality setting, which correlates to a particular level for 
     all other settings.
     
     However, specific cards within a particular family may need additional tweaking.  Let's say there is a known
     issue with the GeForce 7600 GS where Displacement runs very poorly.  We can use this file to specifically
     override post-processing to a lower setting.  This only changes the default value to use when we assign settings
     during AutoDetect.  It does not change what is actually available in the drop-downs.
     
     Each element represents a different option to override for a particular overall quality.  You can override as many or as 
     few options as you want.  Any options that are not overridden will use the default for that family.
     
     ALL TAGS AND VALUES ARE CASE-SENSITIVE!
     
     VideoCardOption:           This encompasses all the overrides for a given video card.  The id is the numerical 
                                identifier for that specific device.  You can get this value by issuing the 
                                cheat "deviceid"
                        
     Ultra, High, Medium, Low:  This specifies the defaults you want to override for the given overall quality.
