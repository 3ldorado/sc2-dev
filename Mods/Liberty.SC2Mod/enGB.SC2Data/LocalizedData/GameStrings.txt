Conversation/Tutorial/Line00001=In StarCraft II you view the battle from above as the commander of an army. Use the mouse to control your view of the battlefield and issue orders to units under your command.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00002=In the lower left of your screen is a minimap that allows you to see what is happening in any part of the battlefield.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00003=In the lower right of your screen you can find the command card. The command card is used to issue orders to selected units.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00004=The lower middle of your screen is the unit information panel. This shows information about the units or structures you have selected.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00005=Above the command card is the"Tip" button. The "Tip" button appears when there is new information for your perusal. Simply click the "Tip" button to read the tip, or click on the "Help" button at the top of the screen.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00006=To change your view, move the mouse cursor to the edge of the screen. When your mouse touches the edge of the screen, your view will slide in that direction.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00007=You can also use the minimap to shift your view to any part of the battlefield. Simply left-click on the mini-map to jump to a new location.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00008=Now that you have a unit selected, right-click on the ground to order the unit to move somewhere.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00009=To move a unit you must first select it. Use your mouse and left-click on the unit to select it.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00010=Well done commander.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00011=To attack an enemy, select your units and right-click on the enemy.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00012=During the attack, you can mouse over the enemy to see a bar representing their life. A unit is destroyed when its hit-points reach zero. You can also mouse over your own units to keep an eye on their life bars.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00013=You can also use the attack-move command to tell your units to move to a location and attack any enemy forces they encounter along the way.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00014=To make an attack-move command, left-click on the attack button from the command card while your units are selected, and then left-click on the ground where you want your units to go.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00015=To create a new terran structure, first select an SCV by left-clicking.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00016=Now left-click the "Build Structure" button in the lower right of your screen.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00017=Left-click on the structure you want to build and then left-click anywhere on the ground to order the SCV to place the new structure. The SCV will move to your chosen location, and build the structure there.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00018=The Command Center cannot be constructed too close to minerals. When placing the Command Center look for the overlay to be completely green before left-clicking.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00019=SCVs are your primary means of collecting resources. While your SCV is selected, right-click a mineral field to begin collecting resources.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00020=Your SCV will start harvesting Minerals and dropping them off at the closest Command Center.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00021=You can train more SCVs from the Command Center to gather Minerals faster.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00022=When you have collected enough resources, you can build additional units and structures. Your current resource totals are displayed in the upper right of your screen.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00023=Well done commander. Harvesting Minerals is central to any terran strategy.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00024=To create new units, you must first select a structure that trains units. Select a Barracks to see what units you can train from it. Those units will appear in the command card in the lower right of your screen.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00025=Left-click on the "Marine" button in the command card to order the Barracks to begin training that unit. Once the unit is complete, it will appear next to the Barracks.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00026=You can queue multiple units at the same time. Simply click on the button again to add another Marine to the queue.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00027=Before you can train a unit, you must have the supplies to support that unit. If you do not have enough available supply, you will not be able to train that unit.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00028=To increase the maximum number of units available, you must build supply depots. To do this, select an SCV and left-click the Build Structures button. Left-click on Build Supply Depot and left-click anywhere to place the Supply Depot.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00029=Your current supply maximum is displayed in the upper right corner of the screen along with how much supply you are currently using.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00030=The Zerg are a savage alien race made up of a host of different species that all mutate from a single creature type called a Larva.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00031=The Zerg create a thick layer of bio-matter called creep under all of their bases and use creatures called Overlords to provide supply for their armies.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00032=Many Zerg creatures can morph from one form to another on the battlefield. Zerg structures can also mutate from one form to another, growing more powerful and unlocking new unit types as they do.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00033=The Drone is consumed when the structure is created, so you will need another Drone to build another structure.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00034=Creep is an organic growth that spreads around any Zerg base. Most Zerg units will move more quickly when they're on creep, and all Zerg structures except Hatcheries must be built on it. Structures that are no longer on creep will slowly die.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00035=Creep is generated by Hatcheries, Queens, and Overlords, so you can use these units and structures to expand your creep.   
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00036=To mutate a Zerg structure, first select a Drone. On the command card left-click the Basic Mutation button and left-click again to choose a Hatchery. Then left-click to place the Hatchery.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00037=The Hatchery cannot be placed too close to minerals. When trying to place the Hatchery look for the structure overlay to be completely green before placing.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00038=Zerg units are created from Larva. To create a Zerg Drone, left-click on a Hatchery and then left-click on the select larva button on the command card.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00039=With a larva selected you can left-click on the Morph to Drone button in the command card to order the larva to morph into a Drone.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00040=Each Hatchery generates additional larva over time.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00041=To create a Protoss structure, select a probe and left-click on the Build Structures button on the command card. Then left-click Warp in Nexus and left-click the ground to create that structure.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00042=The Nexus cannot be placed too close to minerals. When trying to place the Nexus look for the structure overlay to be completely green before placing.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00043=Before you can warp in a unit, you must have the supplies to support that unit. If you do not have enough available supply, you will not be able to warp in that unit.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00044=The Protoss are an ancient alien race that employ advanced technologies and powerful psionics to defeat their enemies.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00045=Protoss have shields on their units and structures to protect them from enemy attacks. Shield strength is represented by a blue bar above the hit-point bar.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00046=Shields are reduced by enemy attacks in the same manner as hit-points, however shields regenerate quickly after combat has finished. 
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00047=Xel'Naga Watch Towers can be controlled by any player. Place a unit near the Watch Tower to activate it and reveal a large area of the battlefield.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00048=If several players have units near a Watch Tower then the tower is not controlled and no player can activate it.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00049=Some obstacles can be destroyed by weapons fire, and you can attack obstacles to clear a path for your troops.  
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00050=Some features like shrubs and smoke will block your vision. Your units can move through these features freely but only flying units can see past them.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00051=You can put your units into control groups. This makes it easy to quickly select a group of units.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00052=To create a control group, select your units and left-click the Control Group button. You can find the Control Group button above the information panel in the lower middle of your screen.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00053=You can hold down the Shift key on your keyboard to give a unit a large number of orders. The unit will then carry out those orders one after another.
